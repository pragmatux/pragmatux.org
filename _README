This website is statically generated by custom scripts according to a template
a scheme I'm calling _underscore_.

The _make.sh script builds the website under the directory '_site/.' Files or
directories beginning or ending with an underscore character ('_') are not
copied. Those beginning with an underscore are support files used in the
generation of the site. Those files with names ending in an underscore are
subject to template processing, and written to '_site/' with the trailing
underscore in their name removed.

Template files are scanned for lines containing markup of the form:

    {{ scheme:filepath }}

These lines are substituted with the expansion of the markup, which depends on
the scheme. The schemes are described below. Filepaths beginning with a slash
('/') are interpreted relative to the current working directory. Filepaths
without a beginning slash are interpreted relative to location of the template
file being processed.

The 'include' scheme simply injects the contents of the given file.

The 'asciidoc' scheme processes the given file with asciidoc(1), injecting the
HTML output of the xhtml11 backend using the configuration file _asciidoc.conf.
(This typically results in a set of divs, unadorned with asciidoc's typical
HTML header and footer material.)

The programs pandoc(1) and asciidoc(1) must be installed and in the PATH.
